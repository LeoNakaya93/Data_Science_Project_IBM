#This is the final project of the course "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate". After completing all modules, we put in practice all tools we learned trough this course such as: Dataviz, Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Webscraping and Exploratory Data Analysis, among others. We used data from SpaceX to analyze and create some predictive models for successful landing.
